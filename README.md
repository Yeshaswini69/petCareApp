# petCareApp
This android application is for the users of 'Smart pet care system', built as a collage project.
This system was implemented using raspberry-pi connected to a web-camera to monitor pets from a remote location, while being able to provide food to the pets when the owner not available. The pet owners can remotely watch the pets from this mobile application when the connected web-camera on stream.
